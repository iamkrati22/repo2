                    <p class="box-text">A hackathon, also known as a codefest, is a social coding event that brings
                        computer programmers and other interested people together to improve upon or build a new
                        software program.

                        The word hackathon is a portmanteau of the words hacker, which means clever programmer, and
                        marathon, an event marked by endurance.
                        The concept of the hackathon, also called a hack day or hack fest, was born out of the open
                        source community. The first event labeled a hackathon was the OpenBSD Hackathon in Calgary,
                        Canada, on June 4, 1999.

                            A programming competition generally involves the host presenting a set of logical or
                            mathematical problems, also known as puzzles, to the contestants (who can vary in number

                            both free software and open-source software.[a] That is, anyone is freely licensed to use,
                            copy, study, and change the software in any way, and the source code is openly shared so
                            that people are encouraged to voluntarily improve the design of the software.[3] This is in
                            contrast to proprietary software, where the software is under restrictive copyright
                            licensing and the source code is usually hidden from the users.

                            FOSS maintains the software user's civil liberty rights (see the Four Essential Freedoms,
                            below). Other benefits of using FOSS can include decreased software costs, increased
                            security and stability (especially in regard to malware), protecting privacy, education, and
                            giving users more control over their own hardware</p>
